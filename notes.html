  <h2><b>Design Decisions and Features</b></h2>

<ul>
<li>
One goal of the design was to highlight a shared interest and love of ours, cats. We named it ClassyCats, referring to cats for our class. 
</li><li>
Another goal of our design was to make sure it is ADA accessible, since it's the right thing to do, the legal thing to do, and we both feel passionately about it. 
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Colors that meet the contrast ratio of 4.5:1</li>
<li>Links visible by underlines and color change on hover</li>
<li>Font sizes 14 and higher</li>
<li>Images that can be increased in size (without losing resolution)</li>
<li>Images are decorative only</li>
<li>Attempts to add code for screen reading failed.</li>
</li>
</ul>
  
<li>
The third goal was to keep things nice and simple but elegant. We accomplished this by using simple lines and spaces to break content into understandable units. 
</li>
<li>
Mary picked the colors and fonts, and we worked to make sure the fonts were consistent across all of the content, which was trickier than we thought because of extra classes on the grading peers page. 
</li>
<li>
We tried shifting the iframes for grading peers to the side and make it larger as we saw another group do. We were unsuccessful. 
</li>There were various other little things that we contemplated doing, but with the turn around on this and considering they were superficial, we didn't complete them. 
<ul>
<li>Centering the day boxes</li>
<li>Having a different cat in every day box (we had plenty of pictures) but they only had three classes </li>
<li>Potentially having a cat as the button image, but it was too much visually</li>
<li>	More "fun" fonts, but they didn't really fit in with our design. </li>
</ul>
  </ul>

<p>Special thanks to Mary for working so diligently on this project. </p>
